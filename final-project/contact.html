    <h1>To Our Valued Customers,</h1>
    <p>

        Together, we find ourselves in an extraordinary situation with COVID-19. In the past several months, things have
        moved very quickly, and this pandemic is affecting all of our communities, our families, our small-businesses
        and our very way of life. We have faithfully been serving the community superior coffee, pizza and gelato/ ice
        cream for the past 10 years, and we are so happy to be able to serve our valued patrons again after a temporary
        pandemic closure.

        We hope you will continue to support small, local businesses, like Vovito, by enjoying our exquisite coffee and
        delicious sweet and savory snack at home or gifting it to family, friends, and your favorite Heroes! We promise
        it will make them SMILE!

        These are unprecedented times and we want to express our deepest gratitude to all those frontline workers who
        are serving our community and saving lives daily.

        If you would like to donate Vovito Coffee or a “HERO Combo” to them, we will happily ship the coffee and snacks
        on your behalf. Thank-you for your goodwill.</p>
